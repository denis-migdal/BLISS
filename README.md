# Brython LISS

Bliss enables to use [LISS](https://github.com/denis-migdal/LISS) with Brython


Web Components are simple to use... but, due to a multitude of non-intuitives behaviors and rules, **hard to use *correctly***. Most of examples and documentation found on the Internet are **unsafe** (cf [List of issues solved by LISS](#list-of-issues-solved-by-liss)).

**LISS enables you to easily use Web Compoments without worrying about all of that.**

## Install LISS

In order to use BLISS in your project, copy either the `/index.ts` or `/index.js` file into your project.

ðŸ’¡ If you need to rebuild the JS file, use the command: `tsc index.ts --strict --target esnext --module esnext`.
